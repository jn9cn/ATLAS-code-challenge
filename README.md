# ATLAS Code Test

An in-progress, side table drawer React app

## Getting started

### Deployed App

Visit: https://jn9cn.github.io/ATLAS-code-challenge/

### Run locally

1. Fork or clone this repo
2. In a terminal, cd into the main directory and `npm install`
3. Start the build process and the app: `npm start`
4. In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app

## Approach

### Initial Plan

1. Initialize project with `create-react-app`
2. Access and parse JSON and display data on table
3. Implement ascending and descending sorts by column
4. Implement drawer functionality using Material UI, SVG assets, and CSS
5. Refine visual presentation
6. Optimize performance
7. Deploy

### Retrospective

This code assessment was a great learning experience in time management and approximating how long specific tasks will take (i.e., what I thought would take more time actually took less time than what I projected would take less time). Though I did not complete this project to my expectations due to time constraints, I am happy at what I've achieved given the amount of interrupted hours I've dedicated to it. Thank you for this opportunity!

## Next Steps

- Lazy Loading JSON data in Table.js
- Refine design elements with CSS
- Refactor for mobile devices
- Write tests
